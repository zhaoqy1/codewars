## Multiples of 3 or 5

### 任务详情

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

### 示例


```golang
Multiple3And5(10) //should return 23
```

### 注意事项

- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
